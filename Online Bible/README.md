# Online Bible (Flask + PostgreSQL)

A small Flask web application that serves Bible text from a PostgreSQL database and renders it through a simple, readable web interface.

This project was built as a hands-on exercise to better understand how a Python backend, a relational database, and a templated frontend fit together in a real web application.

---

## What I Built

- A Flask backend that queries Bible text from a PostgreSQL database
- Jinja templates to render verses dynamically
- A simple banner-based navigation system
- Static asset handling (CSS, JS, images) via Flask
- Basic user registration logic as a foundation for future features

The focus was on **clarity and understanding**, not feature count.

## Why I Built It

I wanted a project that:
- Uses a **real relational database** rather than in-memory or hardcoded data
- Forces me to write and reason about SQL queries
- Keeps the frontend simple so the backend logic stays clear
- Is small enough to fully understand end-to-end

PostgreSQL was chosen intentionally to emulate a more realistic database environment than SQLite.

## Tech Used

- Python
- Flask
- Jinja2
- PostgreSQL
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript

## Notes

This is a personal learning project and not intended as a production-ready platform.  
Bible translations may have their own licensing requirements.
