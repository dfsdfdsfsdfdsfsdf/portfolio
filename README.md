# Ben Kidd - Technical Portfolio
Self taught, Hands-on IT, Linux, networking and hardware and software projects.

I'm hands on, self-taught and I have a strong interest in IT infastructure and I'm looking for a formal role in the IT sector.

I have learned by building, breaking and repairing system, experimenting with home servers, writing automation tools and self hosting services.

This repository will act as a central index for my projects, notes, and index for my projects and experiments as I transition into a formal IT role.
