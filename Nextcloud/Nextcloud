# Self-Hosted Nextcloud for Private File Sync, Photos, and Collaboration

## Overview

This project documents the deployment and use of a self-hosted Nextcloud instance as a private alternative to commercial cloud storage platforms such as Google Drive and iCloud.

The system is used daily by myself and a small group of trusted users as a secure solution for file storage, photo backups, and collaborative document editing — without exposing the service to the public internet.

---

## Objectives

- Replace third-party cloud storage services
- Maintain full control over data and access
- Enable secure file sync and photo backups
- Provide an online office suite for collaborative use
- Avoid public exposure through port forwarding

---

## Core Features in Use

- File storage and synchronisation
- Automatic photo backups from mobile devices
- Shared folders between users
- Online document editing (office suite)
- Cross-device access (desktop and mobile clients)

---

## Architecture

The Nextcloud instance is deployed using Docker and is accessible **only via a private mesh VPN (Tailscale)**.
Clients → Tailscale → Dockerised Nextcloud → Local Storage

There is:
- No public IP exposure
- No port forwarding
- No reliance on third-party cloud providers for access

---

## Implementation Details

- Nextcloud is deployed as a Docker container on a home server
- User access is restricted to devices connected to the Tailscale network
- Each user has an individual account with scoped permissions
- Shared folders are used for collaborative files
- Mobile clients are configured for automatic photo uploads

---

## Use Case

The system is actively used by:
- Myself
- Jess
- David

It functions as:
- A replacement for Google Drive
- A replacement for iCloud photo backups
- A private shared workspace for documents and files

This setup ensures data ownership remains internal while still providing the convenience of modern cloud services.

---

## Security Considerations

- Service is not exposed to the public internet
- Access is limited to authenticated tailnet devices
- All data remains on locally managed storage
- User permissions are controlled within Nextcloud

---

## Benefits of This Approach

- Full ownership and control of personal data
- Reduced dependency on third-party providers
- Predictable access without subscription pressure
- Secure remote access from anywhere via tailnet
- Easily extensible with additional Nextcloud apps

---

## Lessons Learned

- Deploying services behind a private mesh VPN significantly reduces attack surface
- Docker simplifies maintenance and upgrades
- Self-hosted solutions can fully replace commercial offerings when designed carefully
- Access control and usability must be balanced to ensure adoption by non-technical users

---

## Future Improvements

- Storage expansion and redundancy
- Additional monitoring and alerting
- Further automation of backups
- Integration with other self-hosted services

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Docker deployment and management
- Secure network design using private VPNs
- User access and permission management
- Self-hosted cloud services administration
- Practical data ownership and privacy engineering
